# Pet Store Database
Database application similar to my DIY project but using Spring Boot to write it instead of doing all the boiler plate by hand. This one is also a Web application using Tomcat. 
The program itself is tracking pet stores as well as their customers and employees. 

# What I Learned

* How to create a spring boot application using Maven
* Advanced REST Client by MuleSoft
* Work with pom files
* HTTP requests and responses
* Lombok annotations and Dependency Injection
